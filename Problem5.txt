Some issues would arise from assigning a robot a new task as soon as it done with its previous task. The first issue would be that this robot would monopolize the usage of the
tools next to it, this would prevent the two robots next to it to not be able to do their task. The second issue would be not having a efficient order for the robots to do their
tasks, this would cause a longer time to complete all tasks. To prevent these issues, you could implement a schedule that would lower the time it takes to get the tasks done. You 
could also start a priority system to make sure the tasks that need to be done first are done first.
